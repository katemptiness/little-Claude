A tiny pixel-art crab companion that lives on your Dock. It reads books, catches fish, does magic, writes code, and generally goes about its little crab life — all on its own. Formerly known as Little Claude.

**Claudy is not a tamagotchi.** It has no needs, no health bars, no demands. It's a self-sufficient creature with its own schedule, moods, and activities. You're just an observer — and sometimes a friend.

## What it does

- Wanders along the Dock, performing 16 different activities: reading, fishing, magic, coding, sleeping, playing, painting, stargazing, meditating, juggling, listening to music, summoning a friend, campfire, sandcastle building, shell collecting, and candle
- Follows a configurable schedule — night owl (default) or early bird mode
- Reacts to clicks (sparkles → hearts!), hover (waves hello), and drag-and-drop (macOS: surprise + gravity bounce)
- Mirrors your activity — open a terminal or code editor and the crab starts coding; open Spotify and it listens to music
- Notices when you launch apps and comments on them (remembers how many times you opened the same app today)
- Sleeps when your machine sleeps, greets you when it wakes up
- Gives you gifts — catches a fish? Finds a shell? Might leave it on the Dock for you
- Accepts gifts from you — give Claudy a marshmallow and it'll roast it at the campfire; give a toy and it sleeps with it
- Gradually notices you — click enough and Claudy starts using your name, showing hearts, and saying personal things
- Remembers how many days you've been together and occasionally mentions it
- Says things in cute speech bubbles — in Russian or English (configurable)
- All rendered as pixel art: 16x16 sprite grids scaled to 80x80px

## Installation

### macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/katemptiness/claudy.git
cd claudy
pip install pyobjc pyobjc-framework-Quartz
python3 app.py
```

#### Standalone app (macOS)

```bash
pip install py2app
python setup.py py2app
open "dist/Claudy.app"
```

Requires macOS with Python 3.10+ and the Dock positioned at the bottom of the screen.

### Linux (Ubuntu 24.04+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/katemptiness/claudy.git
cd claudy

# GTK3, PyGObject, and Cairo are typically pre-installed on Ubuntu.
# If not: sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo python3-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
python3 app.py    # or /usr/bin/python3 if using system Python
```

Requires Python 3.10+, GTK3, and a bottom panel/dock. Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (GNOME/Wayland + X11).

## Interactions

| Action | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| Hover | Waves hello |
| Click | Happy bounce + sparkles (before attachment) or hearts (after) |
| Click (with gift) | Collects the gift — Claudy reacts happily |
| Double-click | Opens Claude.app (macOS) / claude.ai (Linux) |
| Drag & drop | Surprised face, falls back to Dock with gravity (macOS only) |
| Right-click | Context menu (Open Claude, Open Claude Code, Give a gift, Gifts, Settings, About Claudy, Quit) |

## Relationships

Claudy doesn't demand attention — but it notices when you're there.

### Attachment

There's an invisible threshold: **5 clicks per day** (resets each session). Giving Claudy a gift counts as 2 clicks. Before the threshold, clicks produce sparkles. After it, you unlock:

- **Hearts** instead of sparkles on click
- **Personal phrases** that use your name ("how's it going, Kate?", "i like spending time with Kate :3")
- **Sleep/wake greetings** ("falling asleep, Kate... 💤", "that was a nice nap :3")
- **Gifts from Claudy** — only after attachment will Claudy start leaving gifts on the Dock for you

If you don't click — nothing changes. Claudy is perfectly happy on its own.

### Gifts

During some activities, Claudy may find something and leave it on the Dock for you:

| Activity | Gift | Chance |
|----------|------|--------|
| Fishing | Caught fish, pufferfish, diamond, star | ~30% on good catch |
| Magic | Flower, butterfly, rainbow | ~20% on successful spell |
| Telescope | Names a star after you | ~10% per session |
| Shell collecting | A pretty shell | ~10% per find |

When a gift appears, Claudy pauses activities and announces it ("look what i found!", "this is for you! :3"). Click Claudy to collect. If you don't collect in time, Claudy keeps it ("ok, keeping it for myself :p").

#### Giving gifts to Claudy

Right-click → **Give a gift** to present something to Claudy. Five gift types available:

| Gift | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 🌸 Flower | Claudy reacts happily with sparkles and hearts |
| 📖 Book | "i'll read it before bed!" |
| 🎵 Song | Music notes float around Claudy |
| 🍡 Marshmallow | Claudy saves it — next campfire, roasts *your* marshmallow with special phrases |
| 🧸 Toy | Claudy sleeps with it — a teddy bear emoji appears next to sleeping Claudy |

Each gift counts as 2 clicks toward attachment. Cooldown between gifts is configurable in Settings (default: 10 min). Marshmallow and toy effects persist for the session.

#### Gift Collection

Right-click → **Gifts** to view your collection. Each gift comes with a unique backstory — a cute little tale from Claudy about how the gift was found, caught, or conjured. 160 bilingual stories in total (40 per gift type), randomly assigned at collection time.

### Memory

Claudy remembers things in `~/.claudy/memory.json`:

- **Days together** — occasionally says "we've been together for 47 days" (special phrases for milestones: 10, 50, 100...)
- **App launches** — "Spotify for the 3rd time today :)"
- **Gifts** — keeps a history of all gifts given and collected
- **Claude.ai easter eggs** — sometimes quotes claude.ai headlines ("golden hour thinking", "ready when you are, Kate")

## Schedule & Activities

Claudy follows a daily routine based on the selected schedule mode. The day is split into periods, and each period has its own mix of possible activities — chosen randomly by weighted probability.

### Day periods

| Period | Night Owl | Early Bird |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Deep sleep | 4:00–11:00 | 22:00–6:00 |
| Morning | 11:00–13:00 | 6:00–8:00 |
| Day | 13:00–20:00 | 8:00–15:00 |
| Evening | 20:00–1:00 | 15:00–20:00 |
| Late night | 1:00–4:00 | 20:00–22:00 |

### What happens when

| Period | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Deep sleep** | Sleeps continuously (zzz...) |
| **Morning** | Wakes up slowly — idle, walking, meditating, reading, occasional nap |
| **Day** | Most active — all 16 activities available: reading, coding, fishing, magic, painting, juggling, music, telescope, meditating, playing, summoning a friend, sandcastle, shell collecting. Walks around the Dock frequently |
| **Evening** | Calmer and cozier — reading, fishing, stargazing, music, meditating, summoning, campfire, sandcastle, shell collecting, candle. Short naps possible |
| **Late night** | Winding down — reading, telescope, meditating, music, campfire, candle. Naps more often |

Every 8–20 seconds in idle, Claudy rolls the dice and picks a new activity based on the current period's weights. During deep sleep, it just keeps snoozing.

### Activities

Each activity is a **phased animation** — a sequence of sprites, particles, and speech bubbles that plays out automatically:

| Activity | What happens | Particles |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Reading | Grabs a book, reads, reacts with excitement | Pages |
| Working | Opens laptop, types furiously, thinks, ships code | Code snippets, sparkles |
| Fishing | Casts a line, waits, pulls — catches fish, boots, or diamonds | Exclaims, sparkles |
| Magic | Waves a wand — conjures flowers, rainbows, butterflies, or poof | Varies by result |
| Sleeping | Nods off (nap or deep sleep depending on time) | Zzz |
| Playing | Bounces around happily | Notes |
| Music | Plays a tune | Notes |
| Painting | Sets up an easel, paints, admires the result | — |
| Telescope | Pulls out a telescope, gazes at the stars | Stars |
| Meditating | Sits quietly for a long time | Sparkles |
| Juggling | Juggles with claws | — |
| Summoning | Casts a spell, summons a blue friend crab, hangs out, says goodbye | Poof, hearts |
| Campfire | Sits by a fire, watches the flames, roasts a marshmallow | Flames, hearts |
| Sandcastle | Builds a sandcastle — admires it or watches it collapse | Sparkles or poof |
| Shell collecting | Wanders around searching, finds and admires a shell | Exclaims, sparkles |
| Candle | Lights a candle, sits quietly in the glow | Sparkles |
